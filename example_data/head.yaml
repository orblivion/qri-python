  # format: json
  # Schema defines the "shape" data should take, here we're saying
  # data should be an array of strings, like this: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

# Transform contains instructions for creating repeatable, auditable scripts
# that qri can execute for you. Currently transforms are written in the skylark
# scripting language, which is modeled after the python programming language
# for more info check https://qri.io/docs/transforms
# transform:
#   scriptpath: tf.sky

# use viz to provide custom a HTML template of your dataset
# the currently accepted syntax is 'html'
# scriptpath is the path to your template, relative to this file:
# viz:
#   syntax: html
#   scriptpath: template.html

# the body of a dataset is data itself. either a path to a file on your computer,
# or a URL that leads to the raw data
